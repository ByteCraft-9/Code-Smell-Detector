🚀 C++ Code Smell Detector
Welcome to the C++ Code Smell Detection Tool!
This project uses Next.js, React + Vite for a fast and responsive user interface. It allows you to detect common code smells in C++ source files using advanced parsing techniques powered by AST Parser and C++ Tree-Sitter.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Technology	Description

Next.js	React-based web framework

React + Vite	Fast frontend build tool

AST Parser	C++ Abstract Syntax Tree

Tree-Sitter	Code parsing library

🧩 How It Works

Uses Tree-Sitter to parse C++ source files into a syntax tree.

Traverses the tree to identify common code smells like:

Long methods

Large classes

Deep nesting

Dublicate code

Complex code

Long parameters

Displays detected issues in a clean, visual interface.
